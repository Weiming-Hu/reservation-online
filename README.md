# Online Reservation System

I programme for rock stars !

This is a very simple reservation system.

To run server locally, use the following commands:

```
# Create a virtual environment using python3
virtualenv -p python3 venv

# Activate the environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run server
# If this port is not available, try a different one.
#
python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:5050

# Go to http://127.0.0.1:5050/ in your browser.
```
